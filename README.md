# True-Density-determination-of-Pharmacrutical-Powders-
Aim: To determine true density and percentage porosity of 
the given granules. 
PRINCIPLE: Solid bodies retain their volume and shape 
under atmospheric pressure. An important factor in choosing 
a suitable sample for density determination is the question of 
whether the density is required as a characteristic of a material 
or whether density determination is performed to check for 
defects in a material. The choice of procedure for density 
determination will depend on this factor as well. The density 
of particles, powders, and compacts is an important property 
affecting the performance and function of many 
pharmaceutical materials. By definition, all density 
measurements involve the measurement of mass and volume. 
Mass is determined with an analytical balance and the key to 
obtaining reliable density values is in the accuracy and 
precision of measuring volume. True density is the density of 
the solid material excluding the volume of any open and 
closed pores. Depending on the molecular arrangement of the 
material, the true density can equal the theoretical density of 
the material. True density measurements can be performed onAPIs, excipients, blends, and monolithic samples such as 
tablets. In micrometrics studies high- precision gas 
pycnometer which gives accurate to 0.02% of the sample 
volume are used to determine true density. The porosity of 
pharmaceutical materials and medical devices can impact 
production, material movement, and pharmacokinetic 
behaviour. Tablet porosity determines the tensile strength 
(hardness) of tablets for a given composition. Tablet porosity 
may be regarded as a measure of the tableting process. 
Variations in tablet porosity reflect various 9 1 0 aspects of 
tablet press performance. Tablet porosity may relate to tablet 
disintegration and dissolution. In the case of coated tablets, 
coating quality may be affected by tablets porosity. 
REQUIREMENTS: Chemical Requirements: Lactose, 
calcium carbonate, talc, zinc oxide, etc. 
Apparatus: Measuring cylinder, weighing balance, funnel, 
burette stand. 
PROCEDURE: Determination of true density of the 
material by solvent displacement method
 Weigh accurately a clean and dry density bottle 
 Take the weight of the density bottle with a small 
quantity of powder sample 
 Now fill the density bottle with solvent without 
removing the powder material 
 Calculate the true density of the given powder sampleTrue Density:
Definition: True density, also known as real density or 
absolute density, refers to the mass of a substance per unit 
volume, excluding any voids or pores within the material. 
Calculation: True Density (ρ) = Mass (m) / Volume (V) 
Significance: True density provides a measure of the intrinsic 
density of a material, disregarding any interstitial spaces or 
porosity. It reflects how tightly the atoms or molecules are 
packed within the material’s structure. 
Application: True density is often used in scientific research, 
materials science, and quality control. It is especially valuable 
when analysing pure, solid materials, nanoparticles,
and powder where porosity is negligible. 
In summary, True density delves into the fundamental 
atomic/molecular arrangement. Understanding the 
differences between these density measurements is essential 
when interpreting data and applying them to various fields of 
science and industry.
